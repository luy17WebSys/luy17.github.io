# Lab1
## Struggles
Padding sucks. Lots of things add it by default and working in raw HTML/CSS means you have to actually deal with those defaults and fix them. There was also a lot of fiddling with CSS since I'm not used to working in raw CSS and using selectors as much.

## Yasmine Lu: Struggles
Refreshing on HTML, and working on CSS makes me remember how hard it is to actually code a website. ~~Also working on time management, I'll be better at doing labs.~~  Working with CSS and how to format things also suck (It's a part of why I realized how hard it is to work with it). 

Validating HTML, then the validator telling us all of our errors came from the Google Fonts link also made me rage internally.
